# This Module is only for adding the necessary entries to the mcfg_sw.txt and VoLTE options, if you require a new .mbn file I cannot help. This is only for the Pixel 3 and Chinese carriers. Feel free to modify it. Make sure to delete /data/vendor/modem_fdr/fdr_check and everything in /data/vendor/radio/ before installing module
